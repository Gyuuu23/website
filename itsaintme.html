I had a dream, we were sippin' whiskey neat
Highest floor, The Bowery, and I was high enough
Somewhere along the lines, we stopped seein' eye to eye
You were stayin' out all night, and I had enough
No, I don't wanna know where you been or where you're goin'
But I know I won't be home, and you'll be on your own
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's wakin' up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
It ain't me
No, no, ah-ah, The Bowery
No, no, ah-ah, whiskey neat
Grateful, I'm so grateful, ah (it ain't me)
No, no, ah-ah, The Bowery
No, no, ah-ah, whiskey neat
Grateful, I'm so grateful, ah
It ain't me
No, no, ah-ah, The Bowery
No, no, ah-ah, whiskey neat
Grateful, I'm so grateful, ah (it ain't me)
No, no, ah-ah, The Bowery
No, no, ah-ah, whiskey neat
Grateful, I'm so grateful, ah
It ain't me
I had a dream, we were back to 17
Summer nights and The Libertines, never growin' up
I'll take with me the Polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave behind the worst of us
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's wakin' up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
It ain't me (no, no)
It ain't me (no, no)
It ain't me (no, no)
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
It ain't me
No, no, ah-ah, The Bowery
No, no, ah-ah, whiskey neat
Grateful, I'm so grateful, ah (it ain't me)
No, no, ah-ah, The Bowery
No, no, ah-ah (it ain't me)
Grateful, I'm so grateful, ah
no, no, ah-ah, The Bowery
No, no, ah-ah, whiskey neat (ah, ooh)
Grateful, I'm so grateful, ah (it ain't me)
(Ah, ooh) no, no, ah-ah, The Bowery
No, no, ah-ah, whiskey neat (oh)
Grateful, I'm so grateful, ah
It ain't me
No, no, ah-ah, The Bowery
No, no, ah-ah, whiskey neat
Grateful, I'm so grateful, ah (it ain't me)
No, no, no, no, no, The Bowery
No, no, no, no, no, whiskey neat
Grateful, I'm so grateful, ah
It ain't me
