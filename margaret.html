This is a simple song, gonna write it for a friend
My shirt is inside out, I'm messy with the pen
He met Margaret on our rooftop, she was wearing white
And he was like, "I might be in trouble"
He had flashes of the good life
He was like, "Should I jump off this building now or do it on the double?"
'Cause, baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It kinda makes me laugh, runnin' down that path
When you're good as gold
'Cause when you know, you know
Word to all my friends
With their red flags, their white knights
Their black eyes and their blue lies
If you're asking yourself, "How do you know?"
Then that's your answer, the answer is, "No"
You gotta run, run, run, run like your head's on fire
Run away like your head is on fire
'Cause, baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It kinda makes me laugh, runnin' down that path
When you're good as gold
'Cause when you know, you know
When you're old, you're old
Like Hollywood and me, the diamond on your ring
The soul that you bring to the table
One that makes me sing
In a minor key
'Cause when you know, you know
When you know, you know
So if you don't know, don't give up
'Cause you never know what the new day might bring
Maybe tomorrow, you'll know
Maybe tomorrow, you'll know
Maybe tomorrow, you'll know
I mean, join the party
By the way
The party is December 18
Alright, let's waltz this out, 'cause
'Cause when you know, you know
And when you're old, you're old
Like Hollywood and me, that diamond on your ring
The soul that you bring to the table
One that makes me sing
In a minor key
Diamond on your ring
'Cause when you know, you know
When you know, you know
